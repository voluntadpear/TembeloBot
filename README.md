# Tembelo Bot
Twitter bot that checks once every 24 hours if paraguayan dictator Alfredo Stroessner is still present as one of Colorado Party historical leaders in its [official website](www.anr.gov.py).

It can be found at [@TembeloBot](https://twitter.com/TembeloBot).

For development you can create a [Twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com/) and then create a ```.env``` file with your Twitter API Credentials. With that just run ```npm run start``` and you're done.
